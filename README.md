# Tomster-cli

Tomster-cli is the new component for your Ember-CLI app you didn't know you needed!

This addon will insert Tomster-cli, not only into the background of your Ember app, but also the head of your index.html!

To include this in your app, run `npm install --save-dev tomster-cli`.

BAM. You're done. Can it be that easy? It is.


##TODO
Include Tomster-cli in index.html footer.
